Hello! I'm **Dr. Rubisco** (DOCK-tore Roo-BISS-coe), but my friends call me **Doc**. This name and account is the one I use for and associate with my online life. Pretty much any account associated with this alias uses the username 'thedocruby', so I will often introduce myself as "**Dr. Rubisco (@thedocruby)**".

### About Me
I am a **passionate game developer** and **software engineer** with deep roots in **C and C++**, and professional experience with a diversity of languages, such as **Rust**, **C#**, **TypeScript**, and **Java**. I am **motivated** by a core desire to **create** and **inspire**, and I channel this into everything I do. I enjoy projects in **computer graphics** and **3D rendering**, as well as **physics engines** and **simulations**. More generally, I am passionate about the **scientific** and **mathematical** aspects of programming, with emphasis on **procedural**, **parametric**, **modular**, and **iterative** applications. I am **fond of nature**, and enjoy **hiking**, **camping**, and **foraging** in my lesiure time. I also enjoy many other topics at a hobby level, from **DIY Biochem** and **astrophotography** to **microcontrollers** and **graphic design**.
