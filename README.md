Hello! I'm Dr. Rubisco, but my friends call me Doc. This name and account is the one I use for and associate with my Mojang Account/Xbox Account for purposes related to Minecraft. I try to avoid linking these accounts to my personal accounts whenever possible, so please refrain from personal inquiries. My Mojang account username is Dr_Rubisco (DOCK-tore Rue-BEECE-coe), but pretty much any other account associated with this alias (full list below) uses the username 'thedocruby', so I will often introduce myself as "Dr. Rubisco (@thedocruby)", as above.

I am a passionate programmer with deep roots in C and C++, and experience with many different C-family programming languages. I enjoy computer rendering programs, especially path tracing and other forms of ray tracing, and I may one day develop my own Path-traced Minecraft shaderpack. I started playing Minecraft around the release of 1.9, and started on Java Edition a month or two before 1.11. I started using Java Edition mods/datapacks other than OptiFine in summer of '19, just a couple months after 1.14 dropped. 

Then, in August '20, I started applying my cumulative knowledge of Minecraft Java Edition commands, messing around with datapacks and command blocks to add my own custom features. This was my first experience developing content for Minecraft. With October came Minecraft Live, the first Minecon event I have ever attended. Soon after, snapshots started rolling out, and I became somewhat active in RaysWorks' community of snapshot testers. As November came around, I rediscovered my passion for modding from years ago, this time with [FabricMC](https://github.com/FabricMC) in the picture. I was slowly entranced by FabricMC's mission, and as I became progressively more involved in the Fabric modding community, I simultaneously decided to start developing my own minecraft mods, and to only develop for Fabric modloader.

By the end of November I had dug my fingers into the Fabric community on Discord, and found my way to [The Iris Project](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris). My eagerness to help with development of a Fabric mod, and to learn more about the process of mod development, combined with frustration with Forge and OptiFine, as well as a curiosity about computer rendering and 3D graphics, lead me to devote a considerablle amount of time to monitoring the Iris project. In addition, I tried to learn as much as I can, and contribute where I could, even if it means just reporting issues. As of 3 May '21, I am still an active member of the Iris discord, and I am beginning to develop some of my own Fabric mods as well.

Today, I am interested in all manner of minecraft mods, modpacks, datapacks, shaderpacks, and resource packs, and enjoy developing any and all of those. I am devoted to promoting FabricMC as the more gentle and elegant modloader, and will never develop or contribute to a Forge mod. Despite this, i still cling to certain forge mods, and maintain a private Forge modpack for occasional use in singleplayer. I also enjoy microcontroller programming and small engineering projects. For these I usually use products from [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and/or [PJRC](https://www.pjrc.com/) (my personal favorite).
