Hello! I'm Dr. Rubisco (DOCK-tore Roo-BISS-coe), but my friends call me Doc. This name and account is the one I use for and associate with my online life. I try to avoid linking these accounts to my personal accounts whenever possible, so please refrain from personal inquiries unless on official buisness. My Mojang/Xbox account username is Dr_Rubisco, but pretty much any other account associated with this alias (full list below) uses the username 'thedocruby', so I will often introduce myself as "Dr. Rubisco (@thedocruby)". 

### About Me
I am a passionate game developer and software engineer with deep roots in C and C++, and experience with many different C-family programming languages, especially Java and C#. I have recently taken a liking to Rust, and plan to pursue future projects in that language. I am motivated by a core desire to create and inspire, and I channel this into everything I do. I take pride in my work, and always strive to produce the best product possible. My main focus at the moment is Minecraft mod dev, as I am a passionate Minecraft player as well. I also enjoy computer graphics and 3D rendering programs, especially path tracing and other forms of ray tracing, and I may one day develop my own Path-traced Minecraft shaderpack or voxel engine. More generally, I am passionate about the scientific and mathematical aspects of programming, with emphasis on procedural, parametric, modular, and iterative applications. I also enjoy many other topics at a hobby level, from organic biochemistry and particle physics to microcontrollers and electrical engineering.
