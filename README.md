Hello! I'm Dr. Rubisco (DOCK-tore Roo-BISS-coe), but my friends call me Doc. This name and account is the one I use for and associate with my online life. I try to avoid linking these accounts to my personal accounts whenever possible, so please refrain from personal inquiries. My Mojang/Xbox account username is Dr_Rubisco, but pretty much any other account associated with this alias (full list below) uses the username 'thedocruby', so I will often introduce myself as "Dr. Rubisco (@thedocruby)", as above.

### Who I am
I am a passionate programmer with deep roots in C and C++, and experience with many different C-family programming languages, especially Java and C#. I enjoy 3D rendering and iterative environment sampling programs, especially path tracing and other forms of ray tracing, and I may one day develop my own Path-traced Minecraft shaderpack. More generally, I am passionate about the mathematical and iterative aspects of programming. I also enjoy microcontroller programming and small engineering projects. For these I usually use products from [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and/or [PJRC](https://www.pjrc.com/) (my personal favorite). However, Minecraft has been a passion of mine for as long as I have known the game, and for my life online, this game is the core of my story:

### Discovering my Passion
I started playing Minecraft Pocket Edition around the release of 1.9, and started on Java Edition a month or two before 1.11. That was around 6th grade, and in my Computer Science elective that year, I also discovered my passion and talent for programming, starting off with Block Coding techniques. Later that year, I jumped straight into C++, and experimented with windows console programs constantly. I got my first Arduino microprocessor that April, and began to unfold the endless possibilities that came with computer programming.

### Moving Up the Ladder
I started to mod my game beyond OptiFine in summer of '19, just a couple months after 1.14 dropped. At this stage in my life, I was established among friends as the high school nerd who did math for fun and got great grades on other people's homework, but I managed to keep bullies away by threatening to hack the school's computer system to change their grades and fail them out. My best friends were the math and science teachers, whom I would talk to about advanced topics after class. In 7th grade I had completed all math and english classes for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade, so by now I was a grade above my age group, and taking Advanced Honors english and math. However, my story was interrupted, because in the winter and spring of '19-20, I encountered a horde of family, school, social, and financial challenges as COVID-19 spread fear, hysteria, and lack of toilet paper across the world.

### Minecraft Mania
Then, in August '20, COVID started becoming a normal part of life, and I found new time for Minecraft. I started applying my cumulative knowledge of Minecraft Java Edition commands, messing around with datapacks and command blocks to add my own custom features. This was my first experience developing content for Minecraft. With October came Minecraft Live, the first Minecon event I have ever attended. Soon after, snapshots started rolling out, and I became somewhat active in RaysWorks' community of snapshot testers. As November came around, I rediscovered my passion for mods from over a year ago, this time with [FabricMC](https://github.com/FabricMC) in the picture. I was slowly entranced by FabricMC's mission, and as I became progressively more involved in the Fabric modding community, I simultaneously decided to start developing my own minecraft mods, and to only develop for Fabric modloader.

### The Iris Project
By the end of November I had dug my fingers into the Fabric community on Discord, and found my way to [The Iris Project](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris) (now [Iris Shaders](https://irisshaders.net)). At this stage it was mostly just an ambitious idea, with some proof-of concept prototypes able to run basic shaderpacks. I was instantly entranced by the mission of the Iris Project. My eagerness to help with development of a Fabric mod, and to learn more about the process of mod development, combined with frustration with Forge and OptiFine, as well as a curiosity about computer rendering and 3D graphics, all came together to motivate me to devote a considerable amount of time to Iris. In addition, I tried to learn as much as I can, and contribute where I could, even if it meant just reporting issues. In late May of 2021, After gaining some respect in the Iris community, I was assinged to manage development and maintainence of the official [Iris webpage](https://irisshaders.net), and soon after became a moderator on the [Iris discord](https://discord.gg/jQJnav2jPu). I published the website just in time for Minecraft 1.17.1, and the first official release of Iris. I also started work on [my own shaderpack](https://github.com/thedocruby/VANELLA) in mid-June. However this is no longer actively developed, as drama with online friends and real family started to push me away from Minecraft in the summer of 2021.

### Developer for Life
Months later, In mid october, hype around Minecraft Live pulled me right back into the world of the snapshots, in much the same way that it had a year earlier. I tried to start my own Minecraft YouTube Channel, which had been a dream of mine for a while now, but it only made me realize for the third time in my life that my strength will be and always has been computer science. I jumped back into Fabric modding, and uncovered the [Sound Physics](https://github.com/vlad2305m/Sound-Physics-Fabric) mod, written originally for Minecraft 1.11 by Sonic Ether of SEUS shaders. I found passion like never before developing and maintaining Sound Physics, and so I decided to go all-in for a future as a developer.

### Looking to the Future
Today, I am interested in all manner of minecraft mods, modpacks, datapacks, shaderpacks, and resource packs, and enjoy developing any and all of those, especially mods. I am devoted to promoting FabricMC (and more recently [Quilt Modloader](https://quiltmc.org/)) as the more gentle and elegant modloader compared to Forge, while still just as powerful if not more so. This is why I will never develop or contribute to any developing Forge mod, despite the residual popularity of Forge among the general masses. I finally let go of Forge completely after Minecraft Live 2021, and only stray from Fabric and Quilt when testing shaders in OptiFine. I currently develop and maintain many projects, including Sound Physics and [COMMA Config API](https://github.com/thedocruby/comma). I still actively maintain the Iris website, and I am working on a new website design, as well as a mod trailer, using the Adobe Creative Suite. I am open to collaboration, sponsorship, and employment opportunities, and I am always looking for new ways to gain developer experience and build a reputation online.
