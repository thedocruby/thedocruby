# About Dr. Rubisco (@thedocruby)

Hello! I'm Dr. Rubisco (DOCK-tore Roo-BISS-coe), but my friends call me Doc. This name and account is the one I use for and associate with my online life. I try to avoid linking these accounts to my personal accounts whenever possible, so please refrain from personal inquiries. My Mojang/Xbox account username is Dr_Rubisco, but pretty much any other account associated with this alias (full list below) uses the username 'thedocruby', so I will often introduce myself as "Dr. Rubisco (@thedocruby)", as above.

### Who I am
I am a passionate programmer with deep roots in C and C++, and experience with many different C-family programming languages, especially Java and C#. My main focus at the moment is Minecraft mod dev, as I am a passionate Minecraft player as well. I also enjoy 3D rendering and iterative environment sampling programs, especially path tracing and other forms of ray tracing, and I may one day develop my own Path-traced Minecraft shaderpack or voxel engine. More generally, I am passionate about the mathematical and iterative aspects of programming. I also enjoy microcontroller programming and small engineering projects.
